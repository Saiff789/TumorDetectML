Tumor Detection using Machine Learning 

This code demonstrates a simple tumor detection model using machine learning. It utilizes the scikit-learn library to perform data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. 

Overview:

The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from scikit-learn's built-in datasets. 

Features include various measurements extracted from breast tumor images. 

The code splits the dataset into training and testing sets, trains a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier, and evaluates its accuracy. 

Usage:

Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed (scikit-learn). 

Run the provided Python script to load the dataset, train the model, and evaluate its accuracy. 

The accuracy score of the model on the test set is printed as the output.
